# EEG, Machine Learning and BCI
### Introduction (expandable) 

In this post, there will be explanations of keywords about the subject which is EEG(electroencephalogram) and BCI(brain-computer interface).

All the `unknown terms` will be listed as randomly because I will write the explanations of term one by one when I saw one in an article.

-  Sensorimotor(SMR)
The **sensorimotor rhythm** (SMR) is a brain wave. It is an oscillatory idle **rhythm** of synchronized electric brain activity. It appears in spindles in recordings of EEG, MEG, and ECoG over the **sensorimotor**cortex. For most individuals, the frequency of the SMR is in the range of 13 to 15 Hz.
