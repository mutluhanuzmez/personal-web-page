# EEG, Machine Learning and BCI
### Introduction (will be expand) 

In this post, there will be explanations of keywords about the subject which is EEG(electroencephalogram) and BCI(brain-computer interface).

All the `unknown terms` will be listed as randomly because I will write the explanations of term one by one when I saw one in an article.

 ### Motivation and brief overview (from Abstract)
 - Goal: Designing a powerful EEG data classifier with strong  generalization capability for the development of a motor-imagery based brain-computer interface(BCI). 
 - Proposed Solution: A multi kernel extreme learning machine (ELM)(MKELM) based for motor-imagery electroencephalogram(EEG) classification. 
 
 ### Previous methods (Intro) & their limitations
 - ELM has recently proven to be comparable or better than support vector machine(SVM) for  pattern matching.
 - Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) works for pattern classification if the sample covariance matrices are similar among different classes. But ERD classification it can cause overfitting.
- Common spatial pattern(CSP) and SVM when they are used together, it becomes one of the best classifier for EEG data according to recent researches.

-  Sensorimotor(SMR)
The **sensorimotor rhythm** (SMR) is a brain wave. It is an oscillatory idle **rhythm** of synchronized electric brain activity. It appears in spindles in recordings of EEG, MEG, and ECoG over the **sensorimotor**cortex. For most individuals, the frequency of the SMR is in the range of 13 to 15 Hz.
