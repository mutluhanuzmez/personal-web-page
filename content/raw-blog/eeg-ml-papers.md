# EEG, Machine Learning and BCI
### Introduction (will be expand) 

In this post, there will be explanations of keywords about the subject which is EEG(electroencephalogram) and BCI(brain-computer interface).

All the `unknown terms` will be listed as randomly because I will write the explanations of term one by one when I saw one in an article.

# Paper Examinations and Summaries
##  1- Multi-kernel extreme learning machine for EEG classification in brain-computer interfaces - 2017
 ### Authors
 Yu Zhang, Yu Wang, Guoxu Zhou, Jing Jin, Bei Wang, Xingyu Wang, Andrzej Cichocki

 ### Motivation and brief overview (from Abstract)
 - Goal: Designing a powerful EEG data classifier with strong  generalization capability for the development of a motor-imagery based brain-computer interface(BCI) using extreme learning machine. 
 - Proposed Solution: A multi kernel extreme learning machine (ELM)(MKELM) based for motor-imagery electroencephalogram(EEG) classification. 
 
 ### Previous methods (Intro) & their limitations

 - Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) works for pattern classification if the sample covariance matrices are similar among different classes. But ERD classification with LDA can cause overfitting.
- Common spatial pattern(CSP) and SVM when they are used together, it becomes one of the most popular classifier for EEG data. Common spatial pattern is effective method for feature extraction in classifying two classes of motor imagery EEG data and SVM has good generalization capability with adopted soft margin.
- EffecBayesian ELM is validated

 ### Proposed Solution
  - ELM has recently proven to be comparable or better than support vector machine(SVM) for  pattern matching.

-  Sensorimotor(SMR)
The **sensorimotor rhythm** (SMR) is a brain wave. It is an oscillatory idle **rhythm** of synchronized electric brain activity. It appears in spindles in recordings of EEG, MEG, and ECoG over the **sensorimotor**cortex. For most individuals, the frequency of the SMR is in the range of 13 to 15 Hz.

- Motor-Imagery(MI) ?
-  Extreme Learning Machine?
