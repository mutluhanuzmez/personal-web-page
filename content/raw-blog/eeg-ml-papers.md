# EEG, Machine Learning and BCI
### Introduction (will be expand) 

In this post, there will be explanations of keywords about the subject which is EEG(electroencephalogram) and BCI(brain-computer interface).

All the `unknown terms` will be listed as randomly because I will write the explanations of term one by one when I saw one in an article.

 ### Motivation and brief overview (from Abstract)
 - Goal: Designing a powerful EEG data classifier with strong  generalization capability for the development of a motor-imagery based brain-computer interface(BCI) using extreme learning machine. 
 - Proposed Solution: A multi kernel extreme learning machine (ELM)(MKELM) based for motor-imagery electroencephalogram(EEG) classification. 
 
 ### Previous methods (Intro) & their limitations

 - Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) works for pattern classification if the sample covariance matrices are similar among different classes. But ERD classification with LDA can cause overfitting.
- Common spatial pattern(CSP) and SVM when they are used together, it becomes one of the most popular classifier for EEG data. Common spatial pattern is effective method for feature extraction in classifying two classes of motor imagery EEG data and SVM has good generalization capability with adopted soft margin.
- Effectiveness of Bayesian ELM is validated for EEG classification. However, the randomly assigned node parameters generally result in a large variation in classification accuracy for different runnings with the same number of hiddden nodes.

 ### Proposed Solution
  - ELM has recently proven to be comparable or better than support vector machine(SVM) for  pattern matching. 
  - Instead of using a single kernel, ELM with multi kernel has recently arisen.
  - Two

of

ker-

nels,

i.e.,

and

are

to

differentnonlinear feature spaces.two nonlinear feature provide richer discriminant infor- mation that may be supplementary to each other. Accordingly, we integrated them using a multi-kernel learning strategy to achieve more robust classification of EEG in MI tasks.

-  Sensorimotor(SMR)
The **sensorimotor rhythm** (SMR) is a brain wave. It is an oscillatory idle **rhythm** of synchronized electric brain activity. It appears in spindles in recordings of EEG, MEG, and ECoG over the **sensorimotor**cortex. For most individuals, the frequency of the SMR is in the range of 13 to 15 Hz.
